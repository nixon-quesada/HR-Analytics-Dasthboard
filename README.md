### Project Background
Part of Datacamp's Online Learning Platform and Data Engineering Philippines Scholarship program, this is a redesign of the final output on the "Case Study: HR Analytics in Power BI" Course of BI Analyst career tracks program.
This is a makeover of the final output as well as additional deep dive analysis to uncover better insights that was taught in the course program making it a more portfolio worthy project.

### Data Structure & Initial Checks

Composed of 5 tables, 4 being a dimension(Employee, Satisfied Level, Education Level, Rating Level) and a central Fact table (Performance)

### Executive Summary

The overall project is a case study about HR analysis using all the skills and knowledge of all the previous courses in the BI analyst career track, for most part this course is basically a hands on application of all the theory taught so far, it doesnt have that deep analysis but allows you to utilize all the skills you learned so far in the career course. What I did was to take it a level ahead and do a dashboard makeover with a deeper analysis to uncover insights in the dataset provided in the course.

Overview of Findings:
Most of the analysis in the course are just basic descriptive statistics like number of active and inactive employee, total employee count, number of employee by gender, ethnicity, age as well as displaying intermediate KPI analysis which is the attrition where you apply the DAX techniques taught so far, in the end it's basically a basic case study aimed to apply and have the learner get a practice of their knowledge learned througout the course.

### Insights Deep Dive

Dataset is surprisingly diverse and deep, I did not even thought on uncovering interesting insight but the dataset tells different otherwise, the story from the data tells that the company is bleeding from attrition cost due to the pay gap and descrepancies from technical job roles such as Software Engineer and Data Scientist they are underpaid at way below the average salary line and they are also overworked based on the overtime rate of those people who left, company is also just a nudge below the satisfaction rating level amongs all employee across all the departments and job roles.

# Recommendations:
Critical Financial Risk: The company is losing an estimated $1.4M annually to turnover costs. This reactive expense represents 15% of our total annual salary budget, indicating a massive inefficiency in human capital investment.

Root Cause Identified: Attrition is concentrated in Data Scientist (23.75%) and Software Engineer roles. Diagnostic analysis confirms this is driven by a severe pay gap compared to managerial tiers, not by workload or overtime.

Urgent Action Needed: Immediate salary adjustments for high-risk technical roles are required to reach the 4.0 Satisfaction Target. Reinvesting a fraction of the $1.9M attrition loss into salaries will likely reduce net costs and stabilize the workforce.
